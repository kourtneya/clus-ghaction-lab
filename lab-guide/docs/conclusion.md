# Summary 
You embarked on a journey that created a small Python application which leverage GitHub Actions to implement a CI/CD pipeline. In this lab you explored essential software design basics like building an application using the Python programming language, versioning the codebase using Git, and creating a data format using YAML. You also gained hands-on experience with API Programmability using libraries and invoking RESTful APIs over HTTP. Most importantly YOU BUILT A CI/CD PIPELINE!!.

Thanks for spending time with this lab but your learning isnâ€™t over. Now that you have created a CI/CD pipeline, try enhancing it with a job for code coverage, vulnerability scans, and/or tagging a release. The power is in your hands!
