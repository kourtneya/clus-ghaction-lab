# Task 2 - Create Repository
The goal of this task is to create a repository within GitHub that will store and keep track of the changes for the files inserted in this location. A GitHub Repository is the main place where developers share, collaborate, track issues, and maintain code in an organized and efficient way. 

## Step 1: Navigate to Your Profile 
1. Once you are logged in, click on your profile in the top right corner of the webpage. 
!!! note
    To login or sign up for a GitHub account, please follow the instructions in [Task 1](task_1.md).

2. From the drop down menu, click `Your Repositories`

## Step 2: Create New Repository
1. On the repositories page, click the green button that's labeled `New`

2. Fill in required repository details, 
    1. **Repository Name:** Enter a name for the repository (e.g github-actions-demo)
    !!! info
        Name should be unique and contain no spaces
    2. **Visibility:** indicates who can view the repository. Leave the `Public` radio button selected. 
    !!! info
        **Public:** indicates anyone will have visibility to the information within the repository. Only you and collaborators you invites can make changes to the code within the repository 

        **Private:** will only be visible to you and the collaborators you invite. Only you and the collaborators you invite can make changes to the code within the repository
    3. **Add README** Click the `Add a README file` checkbox under `Initialize this repository with:` section
    4. **Add Git Ignore:** When creating folder location and files the file system may create hidden files and directories that are unwanted. The `.gitignore` file will instruct `git` to not add these files to our GitHub Repository.
        - In the drop down select `Python`, since we will be creating a small python application later in the lab. 
3. Click `Create Repository` once you have entered all the required information
